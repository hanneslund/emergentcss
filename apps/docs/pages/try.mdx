# Try it out

Currently the only way to try it out is with `Next.js` by pointing the `next` dependency to `hanneslund/emergentcss-next`. It has a custom build of `next-swc` with a plugin that uses the compiler.

```json
{
  "name": "app",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "hanneslund/emergentcss-next",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  }
}
```

After that you're ready to style your app by using the `ecss` prop. The plugin will remove the prop and insert a `<style jsx>` tag with the compiler's output.

```
<nav ecss="center font-w=medium gap=4 text-c=neutral-200">
```
